# Overview

This project will use the [2024 League of Legends eSports Match Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1gLSw0RLjBbtaNy0dgnGQDAZOHIgCe-HH) to analyze bans and picks in League of Legends. I aim to analyze the effectiveness and most optimal combos of champion bans and picks, and determine the extent of their effect on match behavior and outcome.
